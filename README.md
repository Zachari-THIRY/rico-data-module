# Data module for the RICO project

This repository contains the data module for the RICO project from SINTEF. The module is written in Python and is intended to be used in conjunction with the RICO dataset. The module is intended to be used for research purposes.

## Installation

Instructions on how to install the project, for example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zachari-THIRY/rico-data-module.git
cd rico-data-module
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a conda environment with the name rico_data. To activate the environment, run the following command:

```bash
conda activate rico_data
```
Note that the requirements are minimal, and should seemlessly integrate with most PyTorch development environments.
